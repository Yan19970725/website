    <h2 >Project History</h2>
    <h3>Origin of the project</h3>
    <p>
      <small>Table tennis originated in England. At the end of the 19th century, tennis was popular in Europe, but due to the limitations of the venue and weather, some British college students moved tennis indoors, using the dining table as the table, making nets, using parchment as rackets, and playing around the table.</small>
    </p>
    <h3>Project changes</h3>
    <p>
        <small>In 1903, the British Goode invented the rubber racket, which strongly promoted the development of table tennis technology.<br><br>In 1926, the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) was officially established and decided to hold the first World Table Tennis Championships.<br><br>From 1926 to 1951, 18 World Table Tennis Championships were held. Most players from all over the world used rubber rackets with cylindrical particles on the surface. When hitting the ball, elasticity and friction are increased, which can make the ball rotate to a certain extent, so there is a defensive way to cut down the spin ball. This style of play has been popular in Europe for a long time, and many athletes have used this method to win the world championship. During this period, the advantage of table tennis was in Europe, of which Hungary had the most outstanding results. Of the 117 world championships, they won 57 times, accounting for half of the European team. But this kind of racket can only be mainly made of downspins.
